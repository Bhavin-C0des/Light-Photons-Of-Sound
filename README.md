This is a discord bot named 'Bright Bot'. The aim of the discord bot is to encourage education among students and to make it fun and interactive in a friendly environment with a competitive spirit. 

Some of the key feature of the bot are :
- Generating MCQ General Knowledge Questions
- A leaderboard system that tracks the progress of the users with a point system that awards the user a point each time they get a question right
- A feature that lets you ask ChatGPT questions
- A command that gives you top news headlines from around the world straight from news agencies

To create endless possibilities of MCQ questions, we will be working on an algorithm that allows the code to generate questions based on a large amount of data that we will collect.
